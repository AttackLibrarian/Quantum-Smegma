# Quantum Smegma

> "If you stare into the modulus long enough, the modulus stares back."

Skullfucking RSA like it's a Friday at Staples.

## **What is this?**

**`quantum_smegma.py`** is a heinously over-engineered, gloriously commented implementation of [Shor’s Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) designed to:

- Factor `N = 2048` like it owes you money
- Run on a 433-qubit machine powered by disappointment
- Strike fear into any cryptographer who still thinks RSA is safe

---

## **Why does this exist?**

Because fuck you, that's why.

---

## Requirements

You’ll need:
- Python 3.x
- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) (install with `pip install qiskit`)
- A *quantum simulator* OR a fuckton of money and some time on a quantum computer.

---

## **Running It**

```bash
python quantum_smegma.py
